# API-WEEK

API-WEEK is a series of challenges provided by MLH. In this project, I completed the Stack Overflow challenge, which involved building a web application that allows users to view detailed information about Stack Overflow users.

## Features

This application allows users to:

- View detailed information about each user, including their reputation and account ID
- Visit each user's website and Stack Overflow profile

These features are useful because they allow users to learn more about Stack Overflow users and their expertise.

## Running the Application

To run this application, follow these steps:

1. Install the dependencies by running `npm install`.
2. Start the server by running `npm start`.
3. View the application in the browser by navigating to http://localhost:3000.

## Screenshots

Here is a screenshot of the users page:

## Demo
